# Introduction-to-Optimisation-Project

This repository was created as a final project for the subject ELEN90026 Introduction to Optimisation at The University of Melbourne.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the method of dual decomposition in solving optimisation problems with separable cost functions. In particular, two aspects of this method are considered:
* Parallel computing
* Floating point errors

## Background

### Separable Problem

$$E=mc^2$$
